# This is day 2 practice of git.

# We are learning to merge two different commits at the RR.

# git status - check the status of your file

# I am adding git.py to staging area then lr then push to RR.

# Git add - add the file to staging

# git log - see the commit updates 

# git push - push to remote repository
